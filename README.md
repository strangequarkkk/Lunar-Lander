# Lunar lander mouse-based game

Python libraries used: Numpy, Matplotlib.

In this project:

  Worked with matplotlib widgets and GUI(graphical user interface) to make a very fun & basic mouse-based interactive game. The motive is to land a rover with a 
  velocity(speed) lower than a preset threshold velocity. The pull of gravity(gravitational acceleration) on the rover can be countered with the 'Thrust' generated  
  by the rover's engine to land with a safe velocity. The magnitude of the thrust generated is to be controlled with a slider.
  
  Can be used to visualize how free-fall in an idealized situation(no air resistance) works, and how the thrust generated by a rocket's engine lowers the velocity of the 
  rocket, allowing the rocket to land safely in practical situations.

To play around with the game, the relevant python script file containing the code needs be downloaded & then executed.

If you need any more information/explanation related to the code, don't hesitate to contact me.
